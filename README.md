> Basic Features

Check out the [Eliza's README](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#-features)

> Extra Features

  - You can still use other blockchains if you want.
- Use [InversifyJS](https://github.com/inversify/InversifyJS) for dependency injection.
  - Share the same instances of providers across the application and plugins.
  - All actions / evaluators / providers for plugins can be dynamically loaded and injected.
  - Provide standard action / evaluator wrapper for plugins.
  - Let develoeprs focus on the business logic of actions / evaluators.
- Use shared `flow.json` for all Flow Cadence contracts dependencies in Flow relevant plugins.
- Both Flow EVM and Flow Cadence projects will be supported.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Python 2.7+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Node.js 23+](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)
- [Flow-cli](https://developers.flow.com/tools/flow-cli)

> **Note for Windows Users:** [WSL 2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-manual) is required.

### Install ElizaOnFlow

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/fixes-world/elizaOnFlow.git

# If you already cloned without submodules, run:
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
<!--
This project iterates fast, so we recommend checking out the latest release.

```bash
# Checkout the latest release
git checkout $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0)
``` -->

### Automatically Start ElizaOnFlow

This will run everything to setup the project and start the bot with the default character.

```bash
sh scripts/start.sh
```

### Edit the character file

1. Open `agent/src/character.ts` to apply modifications on the default character.
2. To load custom characters:
    - Use `pnpm start --characters="path/to/your/character.json"`
    - Multiple character files can be loaded simultaneously
3. Connect with X (Twitter)
    - change `"clients": []` to `"clients": ["twitter"]` in the character file to connect with X

### Manually Start ElizaOnFlow

```bash
pnpm i
pnpm build
pnpm start

# The project iterates fast, sometimes you need to clean the project if you are coming back to the project
pnpm clean
```

#### Install / Add new Flow Cadence contracts dependencies

All Flow Cadence contracts dependencies should be installed to `flow.json` file.
To ensure development and deployment, you need to install all dependencies.

```bash
flow deps install
```

And if you want to add a new contract dependency, you can use the following command:

```bash
flow deps add mainnet://0xAddress.ContractName
```

#### How to use plugins from ElizaOnFlow in original Eliza framework?

Plugins from ElizaOnFlow is compatible with the original Eliza framework but you need to apply dependency injection when you use them.
You can use the following code to use the plugins from ElizaOnFlow in the original Eliza framework.

```bash
# Import packages from ElizaOnFlow to your Eliza project
pnpm add @fixes-ai/core @fixes-ai/common
```

Open the `agent/src/index.ts` file and add the following code:

```typescript
// Import the normalizeCharacter function from the core package
import { normalizeCharacter } from "@fixes-ai/core";

// Load the character file
const startAgents = async () => {
    // ... existing code
    if (charactersArg) {
        characters = await loadCharacters(charactersArg, defaultCharacter);
    }

    // Right after loading the characters
    // Add this line to apply dependency injection and normalize characters, all dependencies will be injected
    characters = await Promise.all(characters.map(normalizeCharacter));

    // ... existing code
}
```

#### Additional Requirements

You may need to install Sharp. If you see an error when starting up, try installing it with the following command:

```bash
pnpm install --include=optional sharp
```
